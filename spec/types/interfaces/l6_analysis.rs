//! L6 analysis: embeddings, topics, search and alert rules. Consumer groups
//! `analyze` and `alerts`.
//!
//! `analyze` is triggered by `TransmissionConfirmed`: embed the matched
//! content, assign a topic, publish `TransmissionClassified`. The clock
//! triggers periodic re-fits, one at a time. A re-fit records its version as
//! `Fitting` in the [`TopicCatalog`]; when `TopicModel::fit` returns, the
//! catalog stores the [`TopicLineage`] from the predecessor (the newest
//! version that is no longer fitting) to the new version, computed from
//! centroid similarity. `analyze` then re-classifies every transmission and
//! publishes `TopicVersionReady`, and the version becomes `Ready`.
//! `TopicVersionActivated` from L7 makes it `Active` and supersedes the older
//! versions. `alerts` evaluates rules against detect and insight events and
//! triages the drafts; on `TopicVersionReady` it remaps every watched-topic
//! rule on the predecessor with [`TopicLineage::remap`] over the stored
//! lineage, so a rule becomes `Stale` exactly when the lineage shows a
//! watched topic without a successor above the rule's threshold.
//!
//! Implementations:
//! - `Embedder`: `LocalOnnxEmbedder`, `ApiEmbedder`.
//! - `TopicModel`: `UmapHdbscanTopics` (BERTopic-style).
//! - `TopicCatalog`: `PgTopicCatalog`.
//! - `SearchIndex`: `PgHybridSearch` (full-text plus pgvector).
//! - `AlertRuleEval`: one per [`AlertRuleKind`].
