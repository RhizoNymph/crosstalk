//! L7 topology: edge aggregation. Consumer group `topology`, triggered by
//! `TransmissionClassified` (after analysis, so edges can be filtered by
//! topic) and `TopicVersionReady` (switch queries to the new version's
//! buckets, then publish `TopicVersionActivated`). Graph and series queries
//! resolve agents, including the ids named in a filter, through the
//! `AgentDirectory`. A contribution rejected as a self-edge is a permanent
//! outcome: its delivery is acked, not retried.
//!
//! A series query is a graph query cut into steps: for the same window,
//! weighting, filter and topic version, the sum of every series value is the
//! graph's [`TopologyGraph::total`], and grouped by edge each series sums to
//! that edge's stat in the graph.
//!
//! Implementations: `TimescaleEdgeStore` (continuous aggregates),
//! `InMemoryEdgeStore` (tests).
