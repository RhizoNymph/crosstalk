# Postgres mode: `serve` on the Postgres stores (P7.3, W8)

With a `store` section, `crosstalk serve` runs the whole pipeline and the
L8 surface on the Postgres stores, `PgBus` behind the publish spool, and
recovers on start: a process killed and started again over the same
database ends in the state of one that never stopped. This page is the
composition (workstream W8 of [postgres_stores.md](postgres_stores.md),
which holds the reviewed design and its decisions). Without a `store`
section nothing changes: memory stores and `MpscBus` (decision Q7).

## Scope

- `crosstalk-api`: the Postgres store bundle `PgStores<E, B>`
  (`SurfaceStores` over one pool, every layer's Postgres store), its
  evidence records `PgEvidence`, the id policy `PgIds`, and `InProcess`
  generic over a `HostedStores` bundle (memory or Postgres).
- `crosstalk-gateway`:
  - `Live` generic over a `LiveStoreSet` (`MemorySet`, `PgSet`), the stage
    machinery shared, the Postgres stages (`live::pg`), the recovery
    sequence (`Live::start_pg`), `PgFrontierSource`;
  - the gate and the `spool` section (`spool.rs`), the `spool_full`
    capture outcome;
  - `crosstalk migrate` running every layer's migrations,
    `--reset-correlator`, the migration head check and the pipeline lock
    (`store/`);
  - `crosstalk spool --discard-corrupt`;
  - `/readyz`, `/healthz` and `/metrics` in Postgres mode;
  - the start of each role in Postgres mode (`gateway/postgres.rs`).

## Non-scope

- The stores themselves, `PgBus` and the spool: W1 to W7 (their crates).
- Split `proxy`/`pipeline`/`api` processes talking through `PgBus`
  (decision Q9: P9). Each role still runs alone; only `all` captures,
  detects and serves end to end. The `api` role reads the stores and
  rebuilds its node facts every few seconds; its live feed carries only
  config loads.
- The restart and outage end-to-end tests through the proxy, conformance
  over Postgres: W9.
- Wiring the L6 search and alerts consumers, a real embedder and topic
  model (P6).
- A volume free-space check against `spool.max_bytes` (no portable
  statvfs without a new dependency; see Gaps).

## Data and control flow

### Start (`gateway::start`, role `all`)

```text
config (store section) ─▶ DATABASE_URL, deployment secret (ingress.secrets)
lazy pool (no connection yet) ─▶ PgBus::new ─▶ SpoolingBus::open(<data dir>/spool, Gated<PgBus>)
   capture pipeline over the spool (Bodies::SkipStored: FsBlobStore never deletes)
   proxy listener: forwards and captures at once            ops listener   api listener (503 until set)
pipeline task:
   wait for the database (status waiting_for_database)
   ─▶ migrations::check_heads: every layer's applied head == the binary's (behind: not ready, re-checked)
   ─▶ PipelineLock::try_take (held elsewhere: not ready, retried; its own connection, pinged)
   ─▶ Live::start_pg:
        recovering_bus     PgBus::recover_held
        relaying_outboxes  PgStores::open (L6 outboxes flushed), PgAgents::flush_outbox,
                           flow Relay::relay, topology drain
        restoring_flow     FlowConsumer::with_durability(PgFlowDurability)::restore
                           (IncompatibleSnapshot: stopped, needs migrate --reset-correlator)
        rebuilding_nodes   InProcess::host (operators loaded, node facts rebuilt, new feed
                           epoch), Surface::recover_interrupted, persisted watermark read
        subscribing        exchange log + every slot's group (pumped), stages spawned,
                           L7 outbox relay, retention tick, ticker; the gate opens
   ─▶ running; the API router is set; until shutdown, or the lock is lost (pipeline stops)
```

**The gate.** A consumer group that does not exist starts at the log's
head. On a fresh database the pipeline groups are created only when
recovery subscribes them, while capture runs from the first second. So
the bus behind the spool refuses publishes (`Disconnected`) until every
group subscribed: captures and recovery's own publishes wait in the
spool, fsynced, and drain in order under their ids once the gate opens.
`/readyz` shows `capture: spooling` until then.

### Stages over Postgres (`live::pg`)

| Slot | Stage | Over |
| --- | --- | --- |
| L3 | `PgReconstruct`: `ReconstructConsumer`, the exchange kept in `PgExchanges` first | `PgAgents`, `PgConversations` |
| L4 | `PgProvenanceStage`: the engine, then `ExtractionStep` handing to L5 through `DurableInputs`; publish after `deliver` returned `Ok`; tick: `expire` and ledger expiry at `content_retention` | `PgProvenanceStore`, `PgFingerprintIndex`, `PgExtractionLedger` |
| L5 | its own loop (`l5.rs`): commands, checkpoint interval, extracted batches, deliveries kept unacked; checkpoint then ack; under `Ticking::OnSettle` also on every tick | `PgChannelRegistry`, `PgTransmissionStore`, `PgFlowDurability` |
| L6 | `PgClassify`: `crosstalk_analysis::classify::Classifier` (derived id), publish then ack | `PgTopicCatalog`, `PgTransmissionStore` |
| L7 | `PgTopology`: `topology::consumer::handle`; tick: `PgFrontierSource` then `advance_watermark` | `PgEdgeStore` |
| surface relay | node facts and live feed from the bus | the hosted surface |

No evidence slot: `PgEvidence` reads spans from L4's `SpanIndex` and
accesses and resources from L5's tables (a read-only stopgap read of
`flow.accesses`/`flow.resources`: the Postgres registry does not
implement the spec's `AccessStore` yet).

**Pumped subscriptions.** `PgSubscription::next` dropped while its take
commits leaves the delivery held until the reaper's provisional deadline.
Stage loops `select!` deliveries against commands, so each stage reads
through a pump task (`pump.rs`) that fetches only on a pull and keeps a
fetched delivery for the next pull. The one remaining cancellation is an
ack that arrives while the pump fetches (the flow consumer's checkpoint
acks).

### Settling and shutdown

`Live::settle` is shared. A set with deferred acks (`PgSet`) drains the
stages (the flow consumer checkpoints and acks on a drain) before it
reads the groups; quiet means no pending delivery in any slot's group
(`PgBus::group_stats`), nothing in the spool, and no row in the four
store outboxes. Shutdown drains the stages the same way, stops the bus,
joins the stages; the gateway then closes the spool's drainer, the bus
and the pool. `Live::kill` stops as a killed process would (every task
aborted, nothing acked or checkpointed, the bus's tasks stopped without
touching its tables), for restart tests.

### Frontier (`live/frontier.rs`)

```text
ticked_through = PgShardTicks::ticked_through(shards)          (epoch until every shard ticked)
oldest_pending = min(pending and dead-letter `at` of the five pipeline groups, spool oldest_at)
```

The spool is read before the group stats, so an envelope drained between
the two reads is counted by one of them. In-flight proxy exchanges are
not counted, as in memory mode (no registry exists; their times are later
than `now - settle_after`).

### Readiness, health, metrics

| `/readyz` field | Values |
| --- | --- |
| `status` | `ok`, `degraded` (database down, recovery, spool not `direct`), `draining` |
| `database` | `reachable`, `unreachable: <why>` |
| `migrations` | `unknown`, `at_head`, `behind: flow 1 < 2, ...` |
| `pipeline_lock` | `not_taken`, `held`, `held elsewhere`, `lost` (absent for `api`) |
| `capture` | `durable`, `spooling`, `draining (<n> records)`, `dropping: spool full`, `spool corrupt: <segment>` (roles that capture) |
| `pipeline` | `waiting_for_database`, `waiting_for_migrations`, `waiting_for_lock`, `recovering`, `running`, `stopped: <why>` |
| `recovery` | `pending`, a step, `done`, `failed: <why>` |

Ready (200) unless: the spool is full or corrupt, migrations are behind,
the lock is held elsewhere or lost, the pipeline stopped, a task stopped,
or the process drains. The `api` role also needs the database reachable
and migrations at head. A database outage, recovery or a drain leave it
ready, degraded. "Full" means the last capture was refused full and the
spool has not drained back to `direct` since.

`/healthz` adds `bus.groups.<name>.{pending, oldest_pending_micros,
dead_letters}` (read from the database; left out while it does not
answer), `recovery.{outbox_relayed, flow_checkpoint_micros,
accesses_refed, deliveries_redelivered}` and `spool.{state, records,
bytes, oldest_at_micros, oldest_age_seconds, max_bytes, appended,
drained, rejected_full, rejected_io, truncated_bytes,
capture_spool_full}`; `live.watermark_micros` is the persisted watermark
from the first report. `/metrics` adds `crosstalk_spool_*` and the
`spool_full` reason of `crosstalk_capture_uncaptured_total` and outcome of
`crosstalk_pipeline_exchanges_total`.

### Commands

- `crosstalk migrate --config <path> [--reset-correlator]`: extensions,
  then every layer's migrations (`transport`, `canonical`, `reconstruct`,
  `provenance`, `flow`, `analysis`, `topology`, `surface`); idempotent.
  `--reset-correlator` then replaces L5's checkpoint with empty shards
  (`PgFlowDurability::reset_correlator`, decision Q2).
- `crosstalk spool --config <path> --discard-corrupt`: with the gateway
  stopped, drops the corrupt record that stopped the drain and everything
  after it in its segment.

### Ids and cursor keys

`serve` draws every Postgres-mode generator from OS entropy
(`gateway::postgres::SERVE_IDS = PgIds::Entropy`): sink stamps, agent,
merge, conversation, declared channel, alert, operator-audit and surface
ids, envelope ids of captures. Tests pass `PgIds::Seeded(seed)`, which
seeds each generator with `seed ^ purpose` as the memory set does (so a
seeded Postgres run mints the memory run's agent and conversation ids).
Cursor keys derive from the deployment secret, one label per store
(`crosstalk.cursor.v1.{surface,agents,conversations,audit,exchanges,
topics,search,projections,alerts}`).

## Tests

- No database (run): `postgres_down::proxy_forwards_through_outage_and_full_spool`
  (INV-1221: every corpus case forwarded unchanged with the database down,
  captures spooled, `/readyz` 200 degraded `capture: spooling`; then a
  spool too small for anything: every capture `spool_full`, the proxy
  still answers, `/readyz` 503 `dropping: spool full`, the metrics),
  `postgres_down::a_second_process_on_the_data_directory_is_refused`;
  `dst::frontier_covers_spooled_envelopes` (INV-1217, seeded outages and
  drains over the real spool; a frontier ignoring the spool fails it);
  `dst::classifier_redelivery_republishes_the_same_envelope_ids`
  (INV-1202, the L6 step `serve` runs); `live::tests::serve_seeds_id_generators_from_entropy`
  (INV-1220); config, CLI, frontier, recovery-status and head-check unit
  tests.
- Postgres (`TestDb::new_or_skip`, written, not run by W8: node0 is
  unreachable from the workstream's sandbox): `integration::pg_migrate_runs_every_layer_and_is_idempotent`,
  `integration::pg_readyz_reports_behind_then_every_recovery_step`,
  `integration::pg_second_pipeline_waits_while_the_lock_is_held_elsewhere`,
  `integration::pg_frontier_covers_pending_deliveries` (INV-581),
  `integration::pg_frontier_covers_the_spool`,
  `integration::pg_watermark_survives_a_restart`, and
  `crosstalk-e2e`'s `postgres::postgres_mode_answers_as_memory_mode_and_after_a_restart`
  (the wiki relay through memory-mode and Postgres-mode `Live`, the same
  `QueryApi` answers, and the same after a restart).
- Memory mode unchanged: every `ct-eval replay` of the bench runs is
  byte-identical to the base build (export, evidence, score, report).

## Invariants and constraints

| Invariant | Evidence (agent: ran) |
| --- | --- |
| INV-1217 `topology.frontier.covers-spool` | `crosstalk_gateway::dst::frontier_covers_spooled_envelopes` (ran) |
| INV-1220 `surface.ids.unique-across-restart` | unit `crosstalk_gateway::live::tests::serve_seeds_id_generators_from_entropy` (ran); integration is W9's |
| INV-1221 `ingress.proxy.forwarding-independent-of-capture-store` | `crosstalk_gateway::postgres_down::proxy_forwards_through_outage_and_full_spool` (ran) |
| INV-581 `topology.frontier.covers-pending` | `crosstalk_gateway::integration::pg_frontier_covers_pending_deliveries` (Postgres, not run) |
| INV-1202 `transport.consumer.derived-envelope-ids` | `crosstalk_gateway::dst::classifier_redelivery_republishes_the_same_envelope_ids` (ran; the flag covers the whole list, left for the merger) |

- `serve` never migrates; it consumes only against a database at head.
- One pipeline process per database; a process without the lock neither
  consumes nor relays; a lost lock stops the pipeline.
- Forwarding never waits on the database, the bus or the spool; capture
  publishes through the spool, which refuses only when full.
- No pipeline group misses an envelope published before it first
  subscribed (the gate).
- The flow group acks only after a checkpoint; the bus's ack timeout must
  exceed `flow.checkpoint_ms` and `flow.checkpoint_unacked` must fit the
  group capacity (checked at start).
- Memory mode is byte-identical to before (replays).
- Pool: at least `StoreSection::MIN_CONNECTIONS` (3); the pipeline lock
  holds a connection of its own.

## Gaps

- `PgChannelRegistry` implements neither the spec's `AccessStore` nor a
  resource read by id; `PgEvidence` reads `flow.accesses`/`flow.resources`
  itself, and `PgQuiet` counts the four outboxes by SQL. Both belong in
  `crosstalk-flow` (and the layer crates) as reads.
- The free-space warning against `spool.max_bytes` is not implemented.
- The `api` role, run beside a pipeline process, records leftover action
  intents as interrupted at its own start (single-node assumption, Q9).
- A start that fails after `PgStores::open` leaves the hosted surface's
  relay and feed tasks to end on their own.
