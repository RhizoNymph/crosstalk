# Type specification

## Scope

- Every entity in the gateway's data model, its lifecycle states and the
  data known in each state.
- The events that cross the bus between layers.
- The trait each layer of the abstraction stack exposes, and its errors.
- Tests for invariants enforced by checked constructors.

## Non-scope

- Implementations of any trait.
- Serialization formats, database schemas, wire encodings. Implementation
  crates add serde and sqlx on their copies of these types.
- Lifecycle simulation: `design/lifecycles/cascade.yaml`, outside the
  repository, models the same lifecycles for the stateviz simulator.

## Data and control flow

The types follow data through the stack:

1. **L0 ingress.** The `UpstreamRouter` resolves the upstream: by route in
   reverse-proxy mode, or by intercepted host in forward-proxy mode (other
   hosts are tunnelled untouched). The `ClientIdentifier` hashes the
   credential (`CredentialRef`), the account (`AccountHash`) and reads the
   harness headers (`HarnessClaim`, `HarnessIds`, `RequestClass`) into a
   `ClientContext`. A `ProviderAdapter` classifies the endpoint
   (`EndpointKind`): only `Generation` is captured. All of this reads only
   the request head, and the request is forwarded upstream as soon as it is
   routed. `decode_request` (gzip and zstd included) runs concurrently on a
   tee of the body, off the hot path, and yields a `WireRequest`. When the
   response head arrives, the adapter builds a `ResponseFramer` from the
   `ResponseHead` (its content type gives the `ResponseFraming`: SSE or a
   whole body) and its own protocol; a WebSocket connection gets a
   `WebSocketTap` instead (one exchange per turn). `FrameEvent`s drive the
   in-flight `ExchangeStage`. The `DecodedRequest` attaches to the exchange
   when it is ready, and the finished exchange becomes a `RawExchange` on an
   in-process channel. If decoding fails, the exchange was still forwarded
   and relayed, and is counted as uncaptured.
2. **L1 canonicalization.** A `Normalizer` for the exchange's
   `WireProtocol`, handling its `Dialect`, turns a `RawExchange` into a
   `NormalizedExchange`: an `Exchange` that references messages by
   `MessageHash`, plus the `Message`s and any `NormalizeWarning`s. Tool
   arguments are canonical JSON so echoed messages hash the same; unknown
   blocks are kept as `Unknown` parts. Bodies go to the `BlobStore` first,
   then `IngestEvent::ExchangeCaptured` is published.
3. **L2 transport.** Every event is an `Envelope { id, at, BusEvent }`.
   Consumers subscribe by `Subject` within a `ConsumerGroup` and ack or
   nack each `Delivery`.
4. **L3 reconstruction.** The `IdentityResolver` gives a `Resolution`
   (known agent, new agent, or conflict) from the most specific
   `IdentityEvidence`, with harness ids scoped by `IdentityScope`; it also
   applies `MergeRequest`s, and the `AgentDirectory` resolves merged ids.
   The `Threader` resolves `Continuation::Increment` exchanges through the
   stored response chain and gives a `ThreadOutcome` holding a
   `ConversationDelta` (new inputs, new system prompt, output), which is
   published. A conversation's stored history is non-system messages only:
   each delta appends its new inputs and then its output. A compaction's
   history starts with its first request's non-system messages in request
   order (carried-over messages included) and that exchange's output, and
   its first delta's new inputs are those messages minus the ones whose hash
   is in the predecessor's history.
5. **L4 provenance.** The `Segmenter` cuts the delta's output into
   `SpanDraft`s classified by `Origin`. Originated spans are fingerprinted
   and inserted into the `FingerprintIndex` (which accepts only an
   `OriginatedSpan`). New inputs and the output are run through the
   `Decoder`s, fingerprinted and looked up, with an optional
   `SemanticMatcher` for paraphrase. Hits on another agent's span become a
   `ContentMatch` (`DetectEvent::ContentMatched`); a hit in the output that
   no visible input explains has carrier `ReaderOutput`.
6. **L5 flow.** `ResourceExtractor`s turn tool calls and results into
   `ExtractedAccess`es. The `ChannelRegistry` maps each `Locator` to a known,
   declared or new channel, and the access is stored as an `Access`. The
   `Correlator` turns accesses, content matches and clock ticks into
   `TransmissionUpdate`s, which move a `Transmission` through
   `TransmissionState`, choosing its `Route` (`Delegation`, `Channel`,
   `Direct`, `Unobserved`, in that precedence). Channel and transmission
   events are published.
7. **L6 analysis.** For each `TransmissionConfirmed`, the `Embedder` and
   `TopicModel` produce a versioned `Classification`
   (`TransmissionClassified`). Re-fits run one at a time. The
   `TopicCatalog` records a re-fit's version as `Fitting`; when the fit
   returns it stores the `TopicLineage` from the predecessor (the version
   before it in the `TopicVersionHistory`): for each older topic, the new
   topic with the most similar centroid (`LineageEntry::best`, ties to the
   lower id) and every other new topic at or above the lineage floor. The
   re-fit then re-classifies everything and publishes `TopicVersionReady`,
   and the version becomes `Ready`. On `TopicVersionReady`, every watched
   topic rule on the predecessor is carried over with `TopicLineage::remap`
   (`Remap::Remapped` or `Remap::Stale`), so the UI's lineage and the rules
   cannot disagree. `TopicVersionActivated` from L7 makes the version
   `Active` and every older one `Superseded`. `TopicSizes` count topic
   assignments per topic (outliers apart), optionally over a window.
   `AlertRuleEval`s turn envelopes into `AlertDraft`s, which `AlertTriage`
   opens or deduplicates (`TriageOutcome`), and suppresses on sanctioning or
   rule disabling.
8. **L7 topology.** The `EdgeStore` applies each `EdgeContribution` to its
   `EdgeKey` bucket (per topic-model version, `BucketWidth` wide), activates
   a version once it is complete and publishes `TopicVersionActivated`, and
   answers `TopologyGraph` queries over canonical agents with per-edge
   `Share`s. A series query takes a `SeriesGrid` (a bucket-aligned window
   cut into `SeriesStep`s, each a whole number of buckets), a `Weighting`, a
   `SeriesGrouping` (total, topic, route kind, edge) and a `TopologyFilter`,
   and returns a `TopologySeries`: one value per step per group, counted
   exactly as a graph over that step. Summing every value gives
   `TopologyGraph::total` for the same window, weighting, filter and topic
   version, and grouped by edge each series sums to that edge's stat.
9. **L8 surface.** `QueryApi` serves channels, alerts, the topology,
   series, the topic history (versions, sizes, lineage), search,
   transmissions, topics and projections to an authenticated `Caller` with
   `Permission`s. Series and the topic history need `View`: they carry ids,
   counts, times and similarities but no text, and topic labels stay behind
   `Content`. `OperatorActions` publish `PolicyChanged` (stamping author and
   time from the caller) and agent merges back down the stack, and
   `AlertSink`s deliver alerts.

## Invariants and constraints

- The proxy forwards requests and responses unchanged and never refreshes,
  mints, rewrites or strips credentials. Raw credentials are hashed with a
  keyed BLAKE3 and never stored.
- Only `EndpointKind::Generation` requests produce exchanges.
- A request is forwarded as soon as it is routed; nothing on the hot path
  waits for its body to decode. Request decoding runs concurrently on a tee
  of the body, and the response framer is built from the `ResponseHead`
  and the adapter's protocol, never from the decoded request. A
  `RawExchange` holds a `DecodedRequest`, so an exchange whose request fails
  to decode is never captured; it is still forwarded and is counted as
  uncaptured.
- Forward-proxy mode intercepts TLS only for hosts on an
  `InterceptAllowlist`, which can never contain a vendor auth host. An
  unrouted reverse-proxy request is answered locally with 421.
- Credential and account digests are keyed BLAKE3 tagged with the
  `SecretVersion` that computed them; rotation overlaps two versions.
- A `RetryPolicy` has a non-zero initial backoff no greater than its
  maximum; exhausted deliveries are dead-lettered, never redelivered on
  their own.
- Identity scope is the account, else a stable credential, else the
  upstream; a session id resolves only to the session's main agent.
  Response-id lookups for increments stay within upstream and scope.
- A transmission opened and confirmed in one step has a `NonChannelRoute`.
- `TransmissionClassified` carries its `ClassificationCause`; content alert
  rules evaluate only first confirmations, so re-fits never re-raise
  alerts.
- Harness headers are claims: session and agent ids count as identity
  evidence only within their `IdentityScope`, and the harness name never
  does. Rotating credentials and prompt fingerprints never establish an
  agent alone.
- Merges are aliases resolved at read time; a merge request is never a
  self-merge.
- Tool arguments are canonical JSON, so an echoed message hashes like the
  original.
- A conversation's stored history holds non-system messages only. A
  `Compaction` conversation's history is its first request's non-system
  messages in request order, carried-over messages included, then that
  exchange's output, then each later delta's `new_inputs` and output. Its
  first delta's `new_inputs` are that request's non-system messages minus
  the carried-over ones (hash in the predecessor's history), in order.

- A message's role is its `MessageBody` variant: tool calls appear only in
  assistant messages, tool results only in tool messages. Normalizers split
  provider messages that mix roles.
- `MessageHash` is the BLAKE3 of a message's canonical encoding; messages are
  immutable after hashing. An `Exchange` references messages by hash only,
  and every referenced message is in the blob store before
  `ExchangeCaptured` is published.
- An agent always has at least one piece of identity evidence. A merged
  agent's target is never itself and never another merged agent.
- Only originated spans are fingerprinted and indexed. Common spans are
  never indexed.
- A `ContentMatch` never has the same agent as origin and reader, and its
  non-zero `matched_bytes` never exceeds its read range
  (`ContentMatch::new`).
- A span's state changes only through `SpanState::advance`; only an
  `OriginatedSpan` can be indexed.
- A `Confirmed` transmission has at least one content match, and all its
  matches share one sender and one reader (`Confirmed::new`). The sender is
  known only from that state on.
- A `CoAccess` joins a write and a later read of one resource by two
  different agents within the window (`CoAccess::new`).
- A transmission is one (reader exchange, sender, route); later matches
  extend it. Route precedence is Delegation, Channel, Direct, Unobserved.
- No `EdgeKey` is a self-edge (`EdgeKey::new`); every `Embedding` has its
  model's dimension and unit norm (`Embedding::new`).
- A declared channel's detection is `DeclaredDetection` and a discovered
  channel's is `TrafficDetection`, so a declared, never-used channel is
  representable and a discovered, never-accessed one is not.
- Confirmed traffic on a channel raises an alert unless its policy is
  sanctioned (`Policy::on_traffic`).
- Deduplication is a triage outcome, not an alert state.
- In a `TopologyGraph`, edge shares sum to 1 unless there are no edges.
- A `SeriesStep` is a whole number of buckets (`SeriesStep::new`). A
  `SeriesGrid` starts on a bucket boundary and is a whole number of steps,
  at most `SeriesGrid::MAX_POINTS` (`SeriesGrid::new`). A `TopologySeries`
  has one value per grid point in every series, distinct keys, no all-zero
  grouped series and no self-edge series (`TopologySeries::new`). A series
  over a grid built for another bucket width is rejected.
- For the same window, weighting, filter and topic version, the sum of a
  series' values is `TopologyGraph::total`, and grouped by edge each series
  sums to that edge's stat. Series concatenate over adjacent grids, and a
  coarser step sums runs of finer points.
- A `TopicVersionHistory` starts at version 0, which alone is unfitted;
  versions strictly increase; exactly one is `Active`; older ones are
  `Superseded` by the first newer activation, at its time; newer ones are
  `Ready` or `Fitting`, and only the newest may be `Fitting`. A version's
  timestamps never decrease (`TopicVersionInfo::new`,
  `TopicVersionHistory::new`). A failed fit leaves no version.
- A `TopicLineage` goes from a version to the next one in the history, with
  one entry per older topic. Each entry's best link is the newer topic with
  the most similar centroid, ties to the lower id, kept even below the
  floor; the other links are the topics at or above the floor, in lineage
  order (`LineageEntry::new`, `TopicLineage::new`).
- Watched-topic rules are remapped only by `TopicLineage::remap` over the
  stored lineage: every topic to its best link if that reaches the
  threshold, otherwise the rule is stale. The lineage is stored before
  `TopicVersionReady`.
- `TopicSizes` list every topic of the version once (`TopicSizes::new`) and
  count topic assignments, so unlike series they keep transmissions between
  agents later merged into one.
- `TimeWindow` and `ByteRange` are never empty. `Similarity` and `Share` are
  never NaN or outside `0..=1`.
- Bus delivery is at least once. Consumers are idempotent on the envelope id
  and on entity ids.
- The spec has no dependencies; `cargo check` and `cargo test` on
  `spec/Cargo.toml` must stay clean.
